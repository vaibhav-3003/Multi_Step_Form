# React Multi-Step Form
React Multi-Step Form is a small web project built with React and Tailwind CSS that allows users to fill out a form in multiple steps. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can navigate through different sections of the form, providing input and progressing to the next step until the form is completed.

## Features
* Step Navigation: Users can easily navigate between different steps of the form using previous and next buttons.

* Form Persistence: User input is persisted throughout the form-filling process, allowing users to go back and forth between steps without losing their progress.
